## - âš¡  What I am learning ?

The course is complete, yet accessible for beginners. Covering what WebGL is and why using the Three.js library is a must. The various components of Three.js as well as advanced techniques to display millions of particles, add physics, add interactions, create a galaxy, animate a raging sea, etc.

At the end of the course, I should have a deep understanding of Three.js and enough experience to start your own projects.

As a bonus, the course also teaches how to use the 3D software Blender to be able to create our own models.
